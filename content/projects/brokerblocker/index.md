At **100 Percent Property** I owned the end-to-end delivery of BrokerBlocker.ae. The goal was clear: give real estate brokers a spam-resistant channel so they can prioritize verified buyers and tenants.

Key contributions:

- Hardened encryption and contact-whitelisting logic to comply with Dubai data-privacy guidance.
- Reduced API and socket latency by 40% via request batching, optimized caching, and leaner animations.
- Integrated push automations for deal milestones and provided analytics dashboards for sales leadership.

The result is a consistent, trusted channel between brokers and qualified clients, shipped simultaneously on the App Store and Google Play.
