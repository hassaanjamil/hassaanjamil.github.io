As Team Lead at **TPL Trakker** I spent six years building and scaling TPL Maps. We engineered offline vector tiles, live routing, and turn-by-turn navigation designed for local businesses ranging from ride-hailing to delivery fleets.

Highlights:

- Built a reusable SDK so partner teams could embed Pakistani mapping and POI data without relying on international providers.
- Implemented telemetry pipelines, crash reduction efforts, and release automation to support millions of monthly sessions even on low-cost Android devices.
- Led a cross-functional squad (Android, backend, QA, GIS) while shipping tailored versions for automotive OEMs and logistics partners.

TPL Maps now powers routing experiences for enterprises and government agencies that require sovereign data residency and custom layers.
