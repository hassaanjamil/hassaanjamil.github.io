I am a Dubai-based engineer focused on shipping resilient, human-centered mobile experiences and practical agentic AI copilots. During the last decade I have partnered with healthtech, proptech, and mobility companies to launch flagship React Native applications across iOS and Android, scale them to millions of sessions, and continuously improve performance budgets. My current work blends mobile engineering with autonomous AI workflows—designing data pipelines, evaluation harnesses, and on-device inference strategies so teams can trust AI-augmented execution.

Recent highlights:

- Delivered a React Native design system and performance budget that cut cold-start times by 28% for a logistics super-app.
- Productionized a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent that triages enterprise support tickets, reducing manual effort by 40%.
- Mentored 15+ engineers on architecture reviews, observability, and responsible AI deployment.

I collaborate best with teams that care about measurable impact, technical quality, and transparent communication. Let’s connect if you need help leveling up your mobile apps or building autonomous agents that actually deliver value.
